== QUBE
Status:  ALPHA 0

Qube is a lightweight, OpenGL-driven game engine and environment that is written in Ruby, a free, open-source
programming language.  Qube is designed to minimize data repetition by making use of VertexBuffer and DisplayList
objects as specified by the OpenGL language.  Software-based instancing will be provided which allows certain objects to
be 'cloned' to a new instance by linking their DisplayLists.

RDoc documentation will be provided in the "doc/" directory.

Currently, plans include the addition of:
-----------------------------------------
 * Simple client-server environment for networking and login authentication over SSL
 * Implementation of the SIP protocol for host/peer clustering
 * Cairo + OpenGL driven 3D User Interface framework; fully customizable
 * JSON/YAML support for object generation (primarily UI)
